# A1 Nails Salon Website

The **A1 Nails Salon** website is a personal project created to support my family's business. It streamlines appointment booking for both employees and clients while showcasing the salonâ€™s services and products in an accessible, engaging way. The simple UI and limited functionality are designed to ensure ease of use, particularly for employees who may not be tech-savvy, providing an intuitive experience for all users.
